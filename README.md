# Vrutti-ML_FlutterApp
Our proposed system aims to facilitate all the uneducated farmers of our country through an app which brings 2 interfaces under one single umbrella. Currently over 40% farmers can have neither read or write and most android apps for farmers are too complex for them to understand. We have made a very simple application which is very easy to understand. Our voice to answer feature helps farmers clear their doubts through our multilingual voice overs and our deep learning model will help the farmers accurately predict the disease the farmers crop is suffering from.
